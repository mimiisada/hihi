            <strong>Health For All: the ultimate goal</strong>
            <br>
            The World Health Organization’s commitment to Health For All, underpinned by a democratic notion that all humans are equal, shone through brightly in its founding Constitution in 1948. The Constitution was an unprecedented document in a world that was reeling from the destruction of the Second World War, but setting on a transformative path to value all human lives. It uncompromisingly called for health as a fundamental right of every human being and a foundation for peace and security.
            <br>
            Through the decades, WHO has been addressing key challenges for its mission: spearheading efforts to improve social conditions so that people are born, grow, work, live and age with good health. WHO has also been central to the global promotion of gender and disability inclusion. But such progress has been constantly threatened by the persistence of health inequalities. The goal to achieve Health For All, therefore, remains as important today as it was 75 years ago. For WHO, this remains a key pathway to UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3, reinforced by 16 other SDGs to be attained by 2030.

            <strong>Alleviating Deadly diseases</strong>
            <br>
            One of WHO’s key missions is to prevent, alleviate and stop altogether the spread of deadly infections. As a result of an unprecedented global partnership, WHO certified smallpox eradicated in 1980. Smallpox was a highly contagious and fatal disease that claimed an estimated 300 million lives in the 20th century alone.
            <br>
            In the early 2020s, the world is on the brink of eradicating two other damaging diseases – polio and guinea-worm. The WHO’s Global Polio Eradication Initiative has partnered and supported efforts that have helped achieve 99.9% reduction in the spread of polio.
